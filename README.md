# <!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START  -->Project : Medical Image Processing Applications<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END  --> 

## **Introduction** 

This project contains development of an application to evaluate a Medical Image and provide a parameter which will help the doctors in evaluation of the disease.

An Image of a specific body part (Back for project) of a patient having Fungal or Bacterial Infection is provided to the application and this application will calculate the Percentage(Relative Area) of the infected region with respect to the body part having infection.

This applicaion also provides an images of the Infected Area separated from the body.

## **Implementation Steps** 

Step 1 : **Select a language for Implementation** - Python is used in this project for developing as it has [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Library which has many tools that can be used for Image Processing.

Step 2 : **Select an optimal Algorithm** - [Entropy](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/filters/plot_entropy.html) from Scikit-Image is used.

Step 3 : **Tuning of Parameters** - There are many attributes in the implementation which needs tuning to improvise accuracy.

Step 4: **Create an User Interface** - [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) is used. 

Step 5: **Testing** -  Different images are used for testing 

## **Implementation** 

This is the image used for creating the algorithm.
