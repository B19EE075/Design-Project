# <!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START  -->Project : Medical Image Processing Applications<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END  --> 

## **Introduction** 

This project contains development of an application to evaluate a Medical Image and provide a parameter which will help the doctors in evaluation of the disease.

An Image of a specific body part (Back for project) of a patient having Fungal or Bacterial Infection is provided to the application and this application will calculate the Percentage(Relative Area) of the infected region with respect to the body part having infection.
